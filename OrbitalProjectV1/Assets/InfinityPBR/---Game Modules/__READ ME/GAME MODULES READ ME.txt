Infinity PBR Game Modules

Thank you for downloading the Game Modules, I hope they help you out!

Note: Most modules are completely self contained. A few may reference a common script or file outside of their folder structure. Character Creation scene in particular references quite a few scripts which also ship with our characters. Please do not delete any module, as they may reference each other as well, even if you aren't actively using them all in your project.

See scripting examples and documentation here: https://infinitypbr.gitbook.io/infinity-pbr/
