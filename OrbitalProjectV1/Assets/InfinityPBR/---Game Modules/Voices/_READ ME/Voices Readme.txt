Infinity PBR Items Module

Thank you for downloading this module! I hope it saves you time and energy.

The VOICES module adds a system designed to make it easier to populate common lines of AudioClips that may come from multiple voices, as in, NPCS, your characters, etc. Creatively could be used for non-voices too!

NOTE: 
Demo audio clips were created using Replica Studios, an AI voice generator, and used with permission.

While the Voices module will work with any audio clips (including non-vocal clips, if you'd like), if you need various voices for your prototype, I highly recommend Replica Studios.

They have been kind enough to provide a referral code. If you sign up using this code you'll get 60 minutes of free credit (instead of 30), and I'll get 30 minutes of credit added to my account.
